# Biostatistics 835
## Biostatistical Machine Learning for Public Health

For course notes, handouts, and examples see the **Class-Material** folder. For homework and project information see the **Assingments** folder. For general course information see the syllabus.

## Overview

The main focus of this course focus will be on using biostatistical models to predict and provide information on complex public health datasets. We will focus more on prediction of outcome(s) than estimation of the impact of a risk factor. However, some inferential methods for risk factors will be reviewed and (for all methods) techniques to measure variable importance will be discussed. Further, unsupervised learning methods (e.g., clustering) will be discussed. Prediction and predictive inference will be main themes in the course along with learning how to implement the methods in R software. See the Course Schedule below for a full list of topics.

The main topics we will cover in this course (among others) are:

– Linear Regression: variable selection, regularization, dimension reduction

– Linear Classification

– CART and Random Forests

– Support vector machines

– Neural Networks and Deep Learning

– Multiple Testing and Selective Inference
